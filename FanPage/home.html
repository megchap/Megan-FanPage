    <h1>Queen Elizabeth II</h1>
        
   <p>
This website is dedicated to the one and only Queen Elizabeth II! 
She was the longest reiging British Monarch for 70 years.

<h2> My Blurb About the Queen</h2>
<div>
    <p>Personally I find the British Monarchy quite intresting. 
I like learning about the new things that are happening over the pond in our sister country. 
Back in 2016 there was a Netflix show called The Crown started streaming. 
The show is sort of a documentary about the British Monarchy and Queen Elizabth II's life in a dramatic way. 
I highly recommend giving this show a chance! Its a little slow but very intrguing. 
This show has a little to do with why I love Queen Elizabeth so much. 
She was an extremely shy person who never wanted to be in the spotlight. 
Her family wasn't even in line for the throne when she was born. 
However, once her uncle King Edward VIII abdicated the throne her family was force the crown since her uncle had no children of his own. 
Unfortunaly she passed last year on September 8th. I've attached a video that the BBC broadcasted on all TV's in the United Kingdom when they found out about her passing.
